<h2> Trader Joe's</h2>

<ol>
<li> My first impression was of the image at the top. It was simple but nice looking and I loved it. 
I also love the use of color. </li>
<li> Almost all of the information is in the top right. 
They have a search bar, which is always helpful, and a shopping list.
They then have their locations above that, "About Us," "Carrers," and "Announcements." 
I really love their organization. It's very helpful.</li>
<li>There are A LOT of words. The actual products take a little too much searching.
I think they could benefit from having a "Products" tab. It almost feels like it's full of unnecessary information.</li>
<li>I feel like they do have most of the important information right there as soon as you load
up the page. I would say that it makes lots of sense to me.</li>
<li>I love the use of images on this sight. It's simple enough to be understood and also
adds all the visual helps that you need. I love the graphics and layout!</li>
<li>The only idea I have for a font difference is that the logo itself could be larger. The words "Buger Ballet"
are larger than "Trader Joe's" itself. The images are perfect and don't distract.</li>
<li>I really like their navigation tool. It's just a search bar at the top that is simple enough, not
too distracting or anything. It's not like super special or anything though, but it is nice.</li>
<li>They reuse red a lot which I really like, but the blue they add seems a little out of place.
Luckily it's not repeated everywhere so it is really nice.</li>
<li> I really like the way it transfers onto something like a phone. It feel more put together.
You have the little icons but not crowded with information. I'm also really impressed how the
image transferred. It was the perfect divider and quality was great. </li>
<li> A shopping list! I have never seen that used on a website before. It helps you to plan things out
before-hand or just shop online. It was a really cool detail I have never really noticed on a website before. </li>
